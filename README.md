We provide a comprehensive tutorial on implementing a transcription pipeline using Whisper AI for psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience research. The pipeline includes  pyannote-audio, a speaker diarization toolkit by Herv√© Bredin, to identify the speakers, and then match it with the transcriptions of Whisper.
